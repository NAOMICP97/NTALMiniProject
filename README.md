Network Threats and Attacks Laboratory
Abstract: With the increase in number of social media and technology in the field of banking, social networks, e-commerce and marketing; every web application requires a user to enter credentials to have a secure login and access to their personal data. As a result, attacks to steal the credentials of the user in order to gain access to someone else’s personal data for the purposes of masquerading, identity theft and intellectual property theft are increasing exponentially. There is a desperate need to control and mitigate the unauthorized grabbing of information by an attacker which can be done by encrypting and spreading social awareness among the masses about the dangerous tool. Kali Linux provides a Social Engineering Toolkit which allows an attacker to clone as well as attempt a phishing attack on the user in the same network. It clones a webpage on attacker’s local IP thereby diverting the traffic to the attacker instead of original webpage. This report focuses on how the implementation of such an attack is performed and counter measures for the users to prevent such attacks.
